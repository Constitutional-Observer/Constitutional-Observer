## Abstract

What are the arguments that have made India a Secular Republic? There are thoughts and arguments that have allowed the creation of what is modern India: They have come from the visions of the leaders of the Freedom struggle, and those who opposed those visions; These have come from those who wrote the Constitution and those who fought to change it. These continue to come from the visions of our elected leaders and from dissidents who fight for rights denied. 

This platform will allow for a researcher to question many of these groups, the question will be posed to an available corpus of documented debates and statements. And the most relevant answers (paragraphs relevant to the question) will be presented. 


## Long note

The digital is where I had set my microscope on, attempting to look at the many facets of sensationalist, immediate news. Strong imagery, be it in the form of news, speech or media stokes imaginations that are acutely sharp and exist as an established tool to instigate in the nation — it exists a tool for arson.

There may be this imaginary front-line, where independent media attempts to fight dis-facts with facts, narratives with  realities and develop evidence against this emergent arsonist — the amalgamation of the many ills of society. The front-line, however, attempts to deal with decades of forged beliefs with plain and simple sheet metal. Facts are one-dimensioned warriors when your opponent has operated across time, multi-dimensionally – with many blacksmiths.

So to begin to stop looking at just the immediate, I take a step back, what do people use to defend themselves? There is an important distinction here — the media front-line may report to defend, but only serves as information for action. [^1] Whereas, those who offer dissident perspectives through protest and approaching the Courts do so as active citizens [^2]. These perspectives, those that have changed history and those that might are those that I wish to represent with contrast. 

## What are the kind of questions one could ask?

An ideal question, for the sake of a semantically meaningful response from the search engine, should consider both the value of the question  and the presence of keywords that are relevant to the question. 

The subject and object could be entities related to the nation, in the nation, or the nation itself. The verb becomes the topic of discussion, it could be:
- Prayer, religion, god
- land rights
- gender based rights
- freedom of speech, (with regards to religion, sedition etc)
- Based on interpretation of laws (Electoral Bonds, Trusts etc)
- rights of indigenous communities
- tax laws

Ideally it could also be placed on events that happen in the present and things that have happened in the past
- Pre 1950 to include opinions from the CA debates
- Post could include Supreme Court and other relevant judements
- Present day could be derived from the transcripts of the sitting LokSabha and of the Courts
