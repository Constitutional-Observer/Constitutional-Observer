      Constituent Assembly Debates have been sourced from the work of
      Constitutionofindia.net. The data was conveniently sourced from their site
      in the required format due to their efforts. Constitution of India is a
      project by the Center for Law and Policy Research, Bangalore.

      <br /> <br />Lok Sabha Questions have been scraped from over 3 lakh PDFs
      downloaded from sansad.in and other sources, made possible by the work of
      Vonter at the india-representatives-watch repository. It is distributed
      under the ODbL lisence. That repository is sourced from PRS India.
