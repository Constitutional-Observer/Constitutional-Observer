## Note

How do people, as citizens, question the government? Holding the government accountable is one of the primary parliamentary roles of the opposition. However, as common citizens, we do not know much of how the Parliament functions. The realities of our democracy means there are always people who are ignored, sidelined, pushed, reduced and small-cased. What protects their rights?

Those being marginalised exist across a spectrum. There are grave threats to their lives, and there is a slow erosion of their rights. The erosion may be in many ways: In marriage laws, in their right to drink water, in the lack of food availability or in their right to pray.

How have the makers of the Constitution dealt with these? How does the Parliament deal with it? How do people come together to demand? This exhibit explores the making of these questions: What should we question? And how best do we begin questioning? The experiences woven into the web-platform allow you to do that â€” Question more, Question deeply.
